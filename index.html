        <p>St. Xavier offers a wide range of opportunities both within and beyond the curriculum.  We offer extra-curricular opportunities with a vision to grow the range of experiences for students, encouraging them to become intellectually competent, committed to doing justice, more loving, and more religious.  Some clubs are meant to be just for fun and offer a great way to grow socially and make new friends, while others can be a great way to develop and expand leadership skills.

        There is a club fair each year in the Ellis Gym right after the start of the school year where students can learn more about clubs that may interest them.  You can also email the club moderator at any time to find out more information about a club.  Announcements are made during the week letting students know when clubs are meeting and any new or changing clubs.

        If a student is interested in starting a new club or if they have any other questions, they can see Mr. Tim Banker in room 1500 during the school day.</p>

        <p>No one knows how much money Dr. Lyle Tullis gave away to students. I was his colleague for nearly a decade and I never ceased to be amazed at his generosity. He taught sociology; I taught missions.

        Our university has an aggressive program of providing cross-cultural experiences for students. Lots of students take advantage of summer experiences overseas. Early on, I discovered that no group left for overseas without some of its members receiving substantial financial help from Dr. Tullis.

        It wasn't that he made a lot of money. For one thing, he taught at a church-run institution. As a result, his salary was half of what his counterparts earned in nearby tax-supported institutions.

        Other faculty members occasionally groused about comparatively low pay scale. Not Lyle Tullis. Occasionally a professor would leave our campus for a more lucrative position. A couple of them told me they did so because, with higher pay checks, "I can better provide for my family."

        The size of Lyle Tullis' paycheck never seemed to be the most important thing to him. I realized that one day when I was thanking him for helping a student with mission trip costs.

        His eyes twinkled as he said to me, "Aw, I've got so much money I don't know what to do with it. So, I just give it away."

        Most folks wouldn't have thought that way. Dr. Tullis drove one of the older cars on campus. It was certainly older than almost any of the students' cars. His home, while comfortable, was not the fanciest of faculty homes. But Lyle Tullis lived grandly with the feeling that he had so much money he needed to give it away.

        He was one of the favorites on campus. A cynic might say that he bought that approval. But they would misunderstand. Lyle wanted to invest his life, all of it, in people. He'll never leave a large estate; but he will leave a legacy.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Vidya Balan (pronounced [ʋɪd̪ːja baːlən]; born 1 January 1979) is an Indian actress. Known for pioneering a change in the portrayal of women in Hindi cinema with her roles in female-led films, she is the recipient of several awards, including a National Film Award and six Filmfare Awards. She was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2014. Vidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom Hum Paanch. While pursuing a master's degree in sociology from the University of Mumbai, she made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film, and featured in television commercials and music videos. She made her film debut by starring in the Bengali film Bhalo Theko and received praise for her first Hindi film, the drama Parineeta. This was followed by commercial successes in Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006) and Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), but her roles in the romantic comedies Heyy Babyy (2007) and Kismat Konnection (2008) had negative reviews. Vidya went on to establish herself by starring in five consecutive commercial successes, which also earned her critical and awards recognition. These were in the drama Paa (2009), the black comedy Ishqiya (2010), the thrillers No One Killed Jessica and Kahaani (2012), and the biopic The Dirty Picture (2011). The last of these won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office. This changed when she starred as a radio jockey in Tumhari Sulu (2017) and a scientist in Mission Mangal (2019). The latter ranks as her highest-grossing release. Vidya also promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She is a member of the Indian Central Board of Film Certification and hosts a radio show. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and dress sense, but was later credited in the media for her unconventionality. Vidya is married to the film producer Siddharth Roy Kapur.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com. Many school districts have existing school lunch systems. It would be difficult to persuade individual districts to change carriers without a compelling reason. Focusing solely on small districts, up to 2500 students, limits the effectiveness. Accomodating smaller private schools, or larger districts would be helpful.</p>
